## Workshop Details:
GitHub is a popular platform for working collaboratively on software and data projects. This workshop will focus on introducing the features of GitHub that facilitate collaboration. Participants will learn how to propose and discuss changes to a repository. We will discuss ways to manage changes in a safe and controlled manner by using GitHub features such as 'branches' and 'Pull Requests'.

## Workshop Assumptions: 
Some basic familiarity with version control using GitHub.

## Workshop Pre-requisites:
Register for your own GitHub account here before attending the workshop: https://github.com/

## References/Resources
*Note*: These references include more information on using a local `git` client than we discuss in this workshop. They may be useful for future work with `git`/GitHub, but participants are not expected to have read this material before the workshop.
